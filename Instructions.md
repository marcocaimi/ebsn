#Getting started with the Notebook

Note: This is just an example page and you can remove it at any time using the 'Delete Page' button above.

The Codebase Notebook supports publishing content in Markdown, Textile and Plain Text. Each of your
pages will be marked up using the language you choose and displayed to you whenever saved. Every
change you make to a page is fully versioned so you can go back and look at previous versions of
a page at any time.

We strongly suggest you use Markdown for formatting your pages as we have extended it to include
a number of useful features which we have explained below:

##Formatting with Markdown

* Use `**bold text here**` to insert **bold** text
* Use `*italic text*` to insert *italic* text.
* Use hashes (#) to insert headings (for example, `##Level 2 heading`, `###Level 3 heading` etc...)
* Use backticks (`) around any inline code
* Prefix lines with 4 spaces for any block level code
* Prefix lines with `>` for any block quotes
* Use asterisks (*) to create unordered, bulleted lists
* Use regular numbers followed by periods (.) to insert numbered lists
* Use `[Google](http://google.com)` to insert links to external pages

##Extensions added by Codebase

* Use `[[Name of Page]]` or `[[My Folder/Name of Page]]` to insert links to other notebook pages.
  If you link to a page which doesn't exist, when you click the link you will be prompted to create it.
* Use `#123` to link to a ticket within this project
* Use `{branch:repo/master}` to link to a branch within a repository in this project
* Use `{tag:repo/v1.3.1}` to link to a tag within a repository in this project
* Prefix any sentence with `Note:` to display in a yellow post-it style box

##Plain Text

Plain text pages are simply displayed in a monospace font exactly as you enter them into the 
text area field.
